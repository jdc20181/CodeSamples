# BMI Calculator

BMI or Body Mass Index, is a calcualtion to determine if you are overweight. 

Please take notes on the following data:

Formula for BMI

 `weight/( height )^2`
 
 BMI is done using Meters, and KG, so most users will need help calculating this:
 
 1 Meter = 3.28084 FT
 
 1 Killogram = 2.20462 Lbs
 

**Converting Numbers**

 In the Sample, I have a Converter - While we can just do it ourselves, lets do it a longer way, so the user is more engaged.
 
 
Lets say you have 3 Feet, that would be about 1Meter, so a 6ft person would be about 2 Meters.

We have to convert Feet to Meters.

If someone is 100lbs it would be about 45KG.

To make a little simplier, lets do a formula. 

`xFt/3.288084`

Rounding will be fine also, but for this tutorial we are using the full number.

For KG its pretty well the same. 

`xLbs/2.20462`

**Putting everything together**
